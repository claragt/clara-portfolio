I was born on on Bunurong land and raised on land belonging to the Bidjigal and Gadigal Clans. Sovreignty has never been ceeded. I pay my respects to Ancestors and Elders past, present and emerging. I acknowledge the traditions of design and creativity which First Nations and Indigenous people have lived and used through all time. I support [First Nations Futures](https://www.firstnationsfutures.com/co-invest).
