## Designer, researcher and trainer

I’m good at **building capability** in user-centred design through **training and community-based education**. 

I’m determined to bring **equity and justice** into public sector digital transformation. 

I’m a **service designer** and **user-centred design** practitioner with over 17 years of experience. 

I’m Australian and British, an immigrant, a part-time worker and a parent. My pronouns are she/her.

I’m writing [a book called Strong Design](http://strongdesignbook.com/), with [Kara Kane](https://twitter.com/karakane_kk) and [Martin Jordan](http://martinjordan.com/).
