I’m a **service designer** and **user-centred design practitioner and leader**. I try to bring **equity and justice** into public sector digital transformation. 

I **build capability** in user-centred design through **training** and **community-based education**. 

I’m Australian and British, an immigrant, a part-time worker and a parent. My pronouns are she/her.

I’m writing [a book called Strong Design](http://strongdesignbook.com/), with [Kara Kane](https://twitter.com/karakane_kk) and [Martin Jordan](http://martinjordan.com/).

I was born on on Bunurong land and raised on land belonging to the Bidjigal and Gadigal Clans. Sovreignty has never been ceeded. I pay my respects to Ancestors and Elders past, present and emerging. I acknowledge the traditions of design and creativity which First Nations and Indigenous people have lived and used through all time. I support [First Nations Futures](https://www.firstnationsfutures.com/co-invest).
