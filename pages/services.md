I have worked user-centred researcher and designer for 17 years in the public and private sector, in agency and internal roles, and in industries including media, finance, banking, ecommerce and 3rd sector.



I have a BSc in Computer science and a BA in Sociology and Psychology from the [University of NSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), Australia.



Some of my favourite pieces of work are described below. 



# A 12 week user-centred design academy

I created and ran a 12 week user-centred design academy in 2022 with [Mark Wright](https://mrkwrght.com/), at [an agency](https://www.madetech.com/careers/academy/design-and-user-research/). We took 12 people and kick-started their UCD careers in the public sector. It was one of the most rewarding, fun and successful things I’ve done in my working life.

Some of our aims for the academy were: 

* Grow the design and research community at the agency
* Improve the diversity and equity of the agency
* Provide a pathway for entering design and research in tech for people who don’t have education or experience in this sector

You can [read my weeknotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcU3eVhWur_ww8a9P3u_M17HlZQeay-JuhR5zlLwIyQ/edit?usp=sharing) from the academy (which stopped in week 7 because I was heavily pregnant). 

If you’d like me to run something similar for you please, please get in touch. I’d jump at the opportunity to do it again. 



# Government digital services - Lead designer



I worked at the Government Digital Service (GDS) as a Lead Designer for 8 years, 2014-2022. 



The focus of my work at GDS was:

* Equity, inclusion and sustainability in the design of services
* Building capability and growing communities
* Embedding and enabling user-centred design (UCD) in teams and organisations
* Guiding decision making and strategy to enable UCD 



At GDS I developed and ran 7 training courses for the cross-government community, training 1000s of civil servants. I also worked on many services with teams and departments across government and I assessed 28 services.



## Improving equity & inclusion in the design community



## Bringing UCD to a Brexit data project



## Delivering training as an agile service



## Leading design in the Land Registry exemplar



# NHS Digital - Equity and inclusion in digital services, and UCD maturity and capability

In 2021 I worked at NHS Digital with [Sonia Turcotte](https://soniaturcotte.com/) on [equity and inclusion in digital services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dAqglXGTuYjadNg8RkNFtOFqfNgm2jbzGjZwEU3C_Eg/edit?usp=share_link), and on UCD maturity and capability. 



It was a fascinating, complex and exciting piece of work.
