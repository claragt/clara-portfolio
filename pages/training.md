[Get in touch](/contact/index.html) if you’d like to talk to me about your team or organisations’s training needs. 

I can help you:

<h3>Understand your learning needs</h3>

* Map the strengths and gaps of your team’s skill and knowledge
* Benchmark the maturity of research and design in your organisation
* Design learning interventions to support your strategic goals
  <br>
* Create and deliver bespoke training courses
* Develop a programme of learning and support
* Train the trainers to scale up learning
  <br>
* Help you build and support you design and research communities
* Work with you to improve specific issues in your community
* Support building equity, diversity and inclusion in your team

 <br>

I’ve been developing and delivering training and learning experiences for over 20 years, training 1000s of people.

 <br>
  

I believe that supporting and investing in community is the best way to build capability, but training courses come a close second. Get in touch if you’d like to talk about UCD communities.
