I believe that working together is where much of the real work is - collaboration, collective design and co-design.

[G﻿et in touch](https://www.claragreo.com/contact/) if there's a workshop you'd like me to run or some facilitation you need help with. Here are some workshops I've run before:

### Consequence scanning

Consequence scanning is a tool that helps teams and organisations to think about the potential consequences of their product or service on people, communities and the planet. This allows them to have open conversations with stakeholders; to understand what they can influence; and to start mitigating risks and addressing possible harms.

### Reflections on design justice

In this activity we learn about the principles of [design justice](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles). Then each person will think about a piece of work they are currently part of, and reflect on how these principles might manifest there.

### The language of equity, diversity and inclusion

This session will help colleagues understand what power language can have, think about their language use more and be more intentional with the words they chose.

### \
Shadow-values analysis

In this workshop we look at an organisations stated values and interrogate them to understand what the implications and flip-sides of those values could be.



### Why do we do user-centred design (UCD)?

We will thing about why UCD matters for government, and also what happens when we don’t do UCD. We’ll look briefly at the history of design in government, what UCD looks like in the UK government today, and what it could or should look like for you.



### Who are users?

Users are a fundamental concept in user-centred design. Having a robust and nuanced understanding of who we mean by ‘users’ in different service context is often overlooked. 

In this activity and discussion based workshop we’ll look at who are users (and are not), language around different types of users and how different types relate to each other.



### User needs

“User needs” is another core concept in design in government, but it is often misunderstood or misused. This workshop will give participants a thorough understanding of:

* what user needs are (and are not)
* where user needs come from 
* different types of user needs
* what makes a “good” user need
* user needs vs wants vs user stories
* hierarchies of user needs



### Hierarchy of user needs mapping

This method is best for teams who have a large collection of user needs and are not sure how to organise, prioritise and use them direct their work. 

The team will bring the list of needs to the workshop. During the workshop we’ll learn about how user needs relate to each other and map the needs into a hierarchy. We then use the hierarchy to prioritise needs, identify opportunities and generate ideas for solutions at different levels.



Power and equity and justice in user-centred design

Define the problem

Using a user journey map to find problems and solutions

Overcoming the barriers to UCD

Approaches to influencing and convincing stakeholders

### Step-by-step service mapping

A fun and highly interactive workshop to guide a large group of people through planning a service map. Each person reflects on a map they have worked on in the past or one that’s coming up for them soon.
