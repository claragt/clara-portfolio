# What you’ll learn

* What is a service?
* What is service design?
* What are the benefits of service design?
* What does a service designer do?
* How does a service designer work with other roles?

## By the end of the course you will be able to:

* Understand how a service designers’ focus differs from other members of the team
* Use a service design tool appropriately by researching, finding and applying the right tool for a problem
* Understand how a service designer would approach framing a problem
* Use a journey map to analyse a service

The training contains some theory and lots of interactive exercises and activities (individual, in pairs and in groups). You'll meet lots of people from many different roles and organisations in government. You do not need to prepare anything.

# Who it’s for

This course is for anyone who wants to learn more about service design in the public sector in the UK. You might be working with a service designer, commissioning service design or considering service design as part of your own work. You could be working in or with a central government department, local government, NHS, Parliament, arms-length body or regulator.

This course will help you:

* Understand what service design is
* Talk about service design
* Understand how service design applies to your work
* Take a user-centred and service approach to your work

This course is not for people who are already service designers, and it will not make you a service designer.

You must be able to attend all 4 parts of the course, including homework.

Breastfeeding or chestfeeding in the course is welcome, and Clara is likely to be breastfeeding during the course.
