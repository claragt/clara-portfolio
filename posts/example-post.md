# Who it’s for

This course is for anyone who wants to learn more about service design in the public sector in the UK. You might not have a service designer in your team but you want to learn how to better do service design in your team.

You might be a designer new to government, or a product, delivery, tech, user research or data person - this course will help any team member to get an understanding of service design and learn practical tools to apply to their work.

This course is aimed at people working in central government department, local government, NHS, Parliament, arms-length body or regulator. Or people who want to move into the public sector.

This course will not make you a service designer but it will give you practical tools to apply service design thinking to your work.

You must be able to attend all 4 parts of the course, including homework.

Breastfeeding or chestfeeding in the course is welcome, and Clara is likely to be breastfeeding during the course.
