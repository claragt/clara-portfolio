**Iâ€™m starting a new role at [Public Digital](https://public.digital/) as a consultant next week!** 

Weeknotes are a core part of the culture at PD, so I thought Iâ€™d start early.

This week, preparing to start this role has meant practical things like setting up my new laptop and email, getting into slack, choosing my benefits package. Itâ€™s also meant doing some reflection and taking time to write down some resolutions and boundaries for myself.

Iâ€™ve been apprehensive about starting this job. Not about the work itself - Iâ€™m excited about that. Iâ€™m worried about how the working patterns, demands and stresses will fit into my life and my family. Iâ€™ve been working for myself as a freelancer, mostly running training, for the last few years. Going into permanent employment is going to be a big change.

A lot has changed in my life and in myself since my daughter was born at the end of 2022: we moved to Australia, my mum died, we moved back to the UK. Perimenopause entered the building. I havenâ€™t had a permanent role as this new version of myself.

Iâ€™ve sat with my partner and worked out, in detail, who is doing each drop off and pick up, every holiday day, every inset day. Which days weâ€™ll need to postpone swimming, book in an extra day of nursery, check in on childcare swaps with other parents. Iâ€™ve booked the cleaner, the dog walker and the ready meal delivery. Iâ€™m trying to be as ready as I can be for the emotional and logistical changes ahead as well as the professional ones.

*<br />*

These are the prompts Iâ€™ve used for this reflection:

* What am I worried about?
* What do I want to protect?
* What are my previous patterns?
* What affirmations might be useful for myself and what am I great at?
* What do I know Iâ€™m not so good at?

 <br />

And here are some of the highlights of where Iâ€™ve got to:

* I will practice saying no / not saying yes to everything
* I will keep work emails and slack messages on my work laptop only
* I will not apologise for having a family, needing to take time away or not being available for work all the time
* I will meet with my partner twice a week to plan our schedules
* I will not teach white people about racism, and I will resist colonial culture
* I will not have back to back meetings all day
* I will find ways to bring myself and the things that are important to me into my work at PD, including
  - Equity and justice
  - Decolonisation
  - Politics
  - People and community
  - Emotions
  - Grief
  - Going slowly and care-fully
  - Resisting the toxic cultures Iâ€™ve experienced in many workplaces

<br />

I believe the work is going to be great. Itâ€™s interesting work that I care about. I think Iâ€™ll be good at it and also challenged by it. I know thereâ€™s lots of fantastic people at PD, both new colleagues and ones Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with before. And I know that Iâ€™m so so lucky to be able to say all these things. Itâ€™s such a privilege.

I want to start this job with care and intention, for myself, my family and my new colleagues.

Iâ€™ll leave you with a photo of the beautiful State Library Victoria building, which Iâ€™ve been reminded of by a participant in the [Introduction to Service design in government training](https://claragreo.com/training/) course Iâ€™m running with [Ignacia](https://ignaciaorellana.com/) this week.
